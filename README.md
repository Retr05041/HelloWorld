# Hello World
My name is Parker Cranfield, I am a first year CS student at *Nottingham University!*

I have been programming for a few years, and here is some of my code!
There is a lot of Python, as I started there, Some C, Some ARM, I am currently learning Java and when we start creating projects, they will start popping up here!

If you have any questions, make a Issue and Ill be sure to respond as quick as I can, this repo will get updated as soon as I can.
