# Hello World!
My name is Parker Cranfield, I am a first year CS student at *Nottingham University!*

I have been programming for a few years, and here is some of my code!
There is a lot of Python, as I started there, Some C, JS, I am currently learning Java and when we start creating projects, they will start popping up here!

If you have any questions or there are any mistakes (as this is repo is always under development), make a Issue and I'll be sure to respond as quick as I can.

I realise I may not be the best, I hope you enjoy my work.

Thank you and have a wonderful day.
